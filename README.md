# Classification_using_Neural_network
Classification problems can categorize into two types, binary and multi-class based on number of classes. There are different types of other classification approaches like Multi-Label and Imbalanced Classification. Here we will focus on binary and multi-class classification using neural network and its implementation in python.
## Binary Classification
Generally, binary classification problems concern one class that is the positive state and another class that is the negative state. The class for the positive state is assigned the class label 0 and the class with the negative state is assigned the class label 1. For example email spam detection (spam or not), patent having disease or not.
